Assume that we have an analouge sensors for weight and length and the range for them as follows, then :

Weight sensor  : 0 to 10 kg 
Lenght sensor  : 0 to 10 mm  
Register width : 16 bits 

To deal with these sensors we need to convert these values to digital values and this done as follows: 

if we need to get 1kg as digital value we will put the value as : 

( (2^16)-1 ) * (1/10)  = 6553.5 to Greater that we should assign 6554


if we need to get 2 mm as digital value we will put the value as : 

( (2^16)-1 ) * (2/10) = 13107 it is an integer so keep it
